      <h2 class="sec-1-title">Education</h2>
      <p class="sec-1-p">I'm only a high school graduate. Throughout my high school years, I never
        tried to get the highest grade in my classes because my ultimate goal was to just try
        to graduate. That lead me to a 1.8 gpa even though I never failed any of my classes.
        But once I realized how important my education would affect me in the future, I tried my best 
        to get my grades up with the time I had left during that year. Eventually, I ended
        up getting the highest grade on my trigonometry and stats class with a 96% ('A') and A's
        and B's on the rest of my classes. With all that in mind, I ended up only reaching a 
        GPA of 2.4 when graduating. This would make me the only high school graduate in my family. 
        Later, I've looked for computer programming classes on my local
        community college, but unfortunately they didn't offer any curriculums in that field 
        and due to my family's financial circumstances, I couldn't afford to enroll in a university. 
        So I decided to teach myself.</p>

      <h2 class="sec-2-title">Self Taught</h2>
      <p class="sec-2-p">I'm learning how to code through YouTube videos and websites like FreeCodeCamp
        and although I face challenges that requires patience and critical thinking, I feel compelled to keep 
        reaching my goals and to complete my objectives regardless the time it takes. The more I look back to when 
        I first started, the more I realized that I have learned so much and that's what helps me to not give up
        and to keep learning. I'm currently working on some of my own projects just for fun such as this personal website
        and hopefully in the near future, create applications that'll help improve our "quality of life" in our daily lives.</p>

      <h2 class="sec-3-title">A Little Bit About Myself</h2>
      <p class="sec-3-p">I'm <span id="age"></span> years old. I've always been energetic since I was young. I like to run
        and exercise. When I was a kid, I was very shy and reserved but as time when on, my confidence grew and this helped me
        to overcome fears and anxiety of public speaking and become a leader. I like to do photography/filming
        as a hobby. I love to try new foods (especially from different cultures) and I like to play video games every now and then.
